## Background

In this mini project  we will use VBA scripting to analyze real stock market data. 


### Files

* [Test Data](Resources/alphabtical_testing.xlsx) - Use this while developing your scripts.

* [Stock Data](Resources/Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsx) - Run your scripts on this data to generate the final homework report.

## Our steps:

* Create a script that will loop through one year of stock data for each run and return the total volume each stock had over that year.

* We will also need to display the ticker symbol to coincide with the total stock volume.
