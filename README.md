In this project we will use VBA scripting to analyze real stock market data.


We will do that by:

* Create a script that will loop through one year of stock data for each run and return the total volume each stock had over that year.

* We will also need to display the ticker symbol to coincide with the total stock volume.

* Our result should look as follows (note: all solution images are for 2015 data).
